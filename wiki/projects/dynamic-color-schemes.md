# Dynamic Color Schemes

Dynamically switch color schemes at runtime, with support for random selection from the iTerm2 color scheme repo and automatic dark/light mode awareness.

- Integrate dynamic color switcher that respects dark/light mode
- Random color scheme picker from iTerm2-Color-Schemes collection (`~/c/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/wezterm/**`)
- Use `get_random_entry()` to pick a random scheme from the glob
