# Standalone Config Repo

Separated the WezTerm configuration into its own dedicated repository to enable faster iteration and specialized AI workflows for WezTerm development.

- Previously lived inside a larger dotfiles repo
- Standalone repo allows focused CLAUDE.md, skills, and wiki documentation
- Enables git worktrees for testing config branches without disrupting the active config
- Supports building custom Claude Code skills tailored to WezTerm development
