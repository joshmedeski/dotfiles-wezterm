# Animated Backgrounds

Use animated background art (like lines.gif) in WezTerm, with animations that change based on Claude Code events such as running, waiting for prompt, and finished.

- Support animated GIF backgrounds in the wallpaper system
- Drive animation state changes from Claude Code events (running, need prompt, finished)
- Use "lines.gif" style generative art as a starting example
- Integrate with the existing background module's overlay and opacity system
